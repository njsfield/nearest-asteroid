## Synopsis

A Node app that accesses NASA’s NeoWS API to retrieve nearest asteroids from earth based on today’s (or nearest days) data. 
When the user clicks the asteroid, a request is sent to retrieve the data.
The data is sorted and 6 tables are created, with corresponding information about the asteroids.
The 6 tables are ordered from nearest to furthest asteroid ‘Miss Distance’ on the corresponding day.
HTML markup is created from the data and served to the page.

## Goal

Include additional search filters so the user can find a specific asteroid, as well as more information about the asteroid itself.
